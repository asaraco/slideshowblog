			<p>Remix albums are perhaps the biggest act of trust an artist can ask of their fans -- aside from re-issues. It's one thing to consistently enjoy an artist's work, but who's to say you'll enjoy the various artists they've chosen to remix their songs? Or worse, what if the artist in question really doesn't know or care what a remix is, but someone has convinced them they should do a remix album, so the record label just appoints some producers who have nothing better to do?</p>
	
			<p>The "remix" concept itself is nebulous. At its most literal, it could just be a different mix of the originally recorded studio tracks (such as <b>The Beatles</b>' 1999 <i>Yellow Submarine</i> CD), or a "single mix" or "extended mix" that's meant to be a better stand-alone experience than the album version. Typically, however, it implies more of a creative re-working of the original song. But these still come in a few different varieties:</p>
			<ul><li>Changing the production style and/or instrument sounds of a song in a way that mostly retains the same mood and structure as the original recording, but wouldn't have been a good stylistic fit for the artist/album</li>
			<li>Changing the instrumental backing of a song to a great enough extent that it's basically a cover, but with the original vocals</li>
			<li>Drastically changing the structure and/or feeling of a song by moving sections around and adding new ones, so that it's basically a new song that heavily samples the old one</li>
			<li>Creating a song that's pretty much entirely different, but shares a few common themes with the original (mostly a hip-hop thing)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whatever type of remix you're talking about, most people would agree that the purpose of a remix is not to "fix" or outdo the original. Like a great cover, a great remix can showcase the underlying strength of a song and emphasize different aspects of it by divorcing it from its original context. Once in a while you'll get a cover or remix that people prefer to the original; but most of the time, the desired effect is to add value to the song, not replace it.</p>
			
			<p>As much variance as there is in approaches to remixes, there's still more variance in exactly what a remix album should be like. At worst, you may just get a retread of the original album with some arbitrary changes in instrumentation. At best, you get something like <b>Linkin Park</b>'s <i>Reanimation</i>, still the gold standard of remix albums. Rather than a pointless rehash, it had the feeling of the band throwing a big party with a bunch of their friends and having fun jamming on their hits. It took on a life of its own, with its own sense of continuity. (One could even forgive the overdone "answering machine" gimmick here, since it actually kind of worked as a fun way to introduce the collaborating artists.) The fact that they threw in some alternate vocal takes and B-sides didn't hurt either.</p>
			
			<p>With all this in mind, I wasn't sure how to feel when <b>Mutemath</b> announced a remix album -- mostly because I'm never sure how to feel when <i>anybody</i> announces one. It contained a brand-new song, so I basically knew right away that I'd be getting it, but what about the rest of the tracks? Well, the band has a long history of reinventing their songs in interesting ways during their live performances; heck, half the songs on <i>Vitals</i> were already re-interpreted several times over during the initial promotional tour for the album. And they have a well-known love of electronic music both old and new. So at the very least, there was never much risk of this being a soulless cash-grab.</p>
			
			<p>So it comes as no surprise that the band members involved themselves in roughly half of the remixes on <i>Changes</i>. Each band member took lead remix duties on one track, plus the "Vitals" remix which mainly uses the original backing, and the "Joy Rides" remix which is essentially an early demo. And, of course, the brand-new title track. So that's 7 tracks out of 13 with the band's direct involvement, and I suspect most fans will gravitate towards these rather than the guest mixes. This could be viewed as a good thing or a bad thing. It makes the album less of a risky purchase for fans, but as a creative work there's a perceived disconnect, where not all of the tracks have the same value or sense of artistic vision. Perhaps this effect could have been mitigated by more tracks, making it more of a grab-bag of previously unreleased material, remixes, B-sides, demos, etc. Of course, I get the sense they didn't <i>want</i> to do something like that; they wanted it to be an album, not a bonus disc. I suppose the end result is somewhere in the middle. Or maybe I'm just a fanboy who <i>really</i> wants to own all the B-sides they've been teasing us with.</p>
			
			<p>Anyway, let's talk about one track that had a major influence on the direction of this album: the "Monument" remix by <b>Eric Disero</b>. This was the winner of a remix contest, in which -- full disclosure -- I was a participant. So, I have a dog in this fight, but I'll just say it's a solid remix. I'm presonally a bigger fan of the "LaLa Remix" the band released in January, which I felt was basically the perfect way to remix the song, somewhat handicapping the contest. That remix matched and even amplified the cheerful, triumphant feel of the song, with a revamped outro that has now become a standard part of the live performance. Disero's remix goes in a different direction. I don't necessarily feel that it suits the song's mood as well, but it's hard not to repeat what the band already did -- twice.</p>
			
			<p>Regardless, Disero's production techniques impressed the band so much that they invited him into the studio to collaborate on a track they'd been kicking around but hadn't yet found a home for. It turned out to be a match made in Heaven; "Changes" seamlessly fuses clubby beats and synths with somber, introspective vocals in a way that's atypical for the band, but works for the song. If you've heard some of the other <i>Vitals</i> B-sides, "Self" and "Fine After All", they come off as less successful attempts at this kind of song. They were a bit gloomy and lacking in energy. An outside perspective was definitely needed here.</p>
			
			<p>After "Changes", the meat of the album kicks off with "Used To", remixed by <b>Paul Meany</b> (going by his remix moniker, <b>mellowmatics</b>). It borrows some rhythmic cues from an earlier version of the song, giving it more of an upbeat shuffle feel with lots of minor-key synth stabs. In some parts it does seem to throw in a few too many disparate ideas that break the flow, but it's a fun listen. Meanwhile, <b>Darren King</b> gives us his spin on "Stratosphere", which is mostly some instrumental riffing on the general vibe of the song with sparse vocal accompaniment. It feels informed mainly by his side of the song's composition: the synth riffs and drum beats. <b>Roy Mitchell-Cardenas</b> gives us the already somewhat-controversial "Remain" remix, which reinterprets the slow-burn power ballad as a drum-n-bass workout. It fits the mood of the song surprisingly well; it's just inspirational in more of a "finishing the last mile of a marathon" way. It does get a wee bit noisy toward the end, though. It might have benefited from some of the more jarring sounds being a buried further in the mix.</p>
			
			<p>"Composed" gets a somewhat slight makeover by <b>Hasta</b>, modifying some of the chords but ultimately giving us a presentation of the song that's fairly similar to the original: falsetto vocals atop a sparse backdrop of warping synths and a boom-click beat. I personally would've preferred a remix that made it sound like more of a "regular" song with fuller orchestration, just to see how it would hold up compositionally. <b>Yacht Club</b>'s remix of "Light Up" didn't impress me much at first, but I am warming up to it. It's an interestingly dramatic spin on the song, almost like something from a movie trailer. (You have to be able to get past the "chipmunk effect" on the vocals, though.)</p>
			
			<p>One of the more surprising highlights of the album is <b>Todd Gummerman</b>'s remix of "All I See" -- what would seem to be a thoroughly un-remixable song, remixed by the band's least-senior member. Todd puts his synth skills on display in a big way here, further cementing his importance in this phase of the band's development. He drops a half-synth-half-organ riff that's as memorable as any hook on the original album, and lends the song a hazy, pseudo-nostalgic vibe reminiscent of <b>Daft Punk</b>'s <i>Discovery</i>. I could easily picture this version of the song being adapted as a concert staple.</p>
			
			<p>The next sleeper hit of the album follows immediately after: "Vitals" with a guest vocal from <b>Flint Eastwood</b>. Taking an instrumental track and dumping a vocal on it sounds like a lazy idea that would just see the two elements getting in each others' way, but they end up grooving incredibly well together. The instrumental is slightly changed, with a few different drum fills and other tweaks to help the vocals out a bit. The ending gets a little busy with the vocals on top of the keyboard solo; but all in all, they managed to transform a very niche, "for the fans" track into something surprisingly accessible. It adds a dimension to the song that wasn't present in the original, and I appreciate both the original and the remix better for each others' existence.</p>
			
			<p>The last of the band-made tracks is a bit of an oddity: a spruced-up demo of "Joy Rides". It's a lot of fun, hinting at the extremely synthy origins of the album, sounding almost like something from <i>Bubble Bobble</i>. But on some level, it still sounds like a demo. I'm glad to have it, but I'm not sure it fits here.</p>
			
			<p>"Safe If We Don't Look Down" is re-imagined by <b>Imagined Herbal Flows</b> (apparently not a shampoo brand) and is one of the more creative guest mixes on the album. It retains a somewhat organic feel by way of the original guitar tracks and spacey drum samples, while still being a good deal more danceable than the low-key original. But the most truly out-of-left-field guest mix is "Best Of Intentions" by <b>JT Daly</b> of <b>Paper Route</b>. This one sounds a bit like something from the <i>Kill Bill</i> soundtrack: funky bass and sampled horns over drum loops. The instruments eventually drop out for a long spoken-word sample of what sounds like a wedding toast with coincidental references to the song lyrics, with somebody wishing "the best of intentions" but still "trying to figure this out". (My apologies if this is from something famous and I'm just not recognizing it.)</p>
			
			<p>The album closes with what I would unfortunately consider to be the least of all the remixes. We already had one remix of "Monument" on the album, so a second one had better be pretty great. But the Kasbo remix of the song falls short of Disero's, the band's, and several others that have been floating around the internet. The digital effect used to slow down the vocal track is distracting, and makes the whole thing sound awkward to my ears. The band's own "LaLa Remix" would've been a much better choice to close the album, even though most people who want a copy of that probably have it.</p>
			
			<p>So where does <i>Changes</i> stand in the pantheon of remix albums? Somewhere in the upper-middle. Mutemath always puts effort into everything they do, but they also work best on their own terms, in a completely controlled environment. Ceding some control to outsiders is more or less required for a remix album. I still can't help but wonder if this would've worked better as a "bonus album" like <b>Sufjan Steven</b>'s <i>The Avalanche</i>, collecting all of the most interesting B-sides, remixes, and demos together in a mish-mash that doesn't quite work as an album, but makes up for it in sheer quantity. Otherwise, I would've liked to hear something more along the lines of the "Changes Mini-Mix" Paul Meany released a few days before the album dropped, which blended the tracks together with seamless transitions that really gave them a sense of continuity. (Admittedly, I am a huge sucker for track transitions, so this may just be a pet preference of mine.)</p>

			<p>Either way, I think Mutemath fans will get their money's worth from this album, and fans of any of the other artists involved should give the whole thing a listen as well. I doubt you'll be disappointed, and you just might discover a new favorite artist.</p>
