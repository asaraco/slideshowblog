			<h2>UPDATE: 01/10/2017</h2>
			<p>I've removed the "music app" from the navigation for this page because I plan to do some different stuff with it later and refactor it into a separate thing. You can still check it out at this link:<br>
				<a href="http://asaraco.net/#/musicapp">Main music app</a><br>
				<a href="http://asaraco.net/#/musicapp2">Gallery view</a><br>
			Meanwhile, I added a nifty logo and more importantly, I made an actual "blog" page to list more than one blog entry at a time. This will be more useful and impressive when I have more blog entries to show off. I also changed various backend aspects of the blog database, and added an inline editing feature if you're logged in. (Username test, password test.)<br>
Meanwhile, the old-school, hardcore blog editing interface from the toolbar has a few new features, although I also have a few deprecated things in there while I'm transitioning some stuff in the database. One of the next steps, obviously, is to make that interface somewhat more user-friendly. But I do quite like the inline editor.</p>

			<h2>UPDATE: 11/11/2016</h2>
			<p>Try clicking the new drop-down arrow in the upper-left corner of the navbar! Login as username & password "test" to gain access to the beta blog editor.</p>
			<p>This is the first step in really having this site function as a real blog site with a database of articles, rather than a million hard-coded HTML files.</p>
			<p><i>(Be warned -- I haven't tested this much with the mobile version yet.)</i>
				
			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>This is Aaron Saraco's website. Currently, it is mostly a testing ground to demonstrate various skills I've been learning. I also plan to use it as a real blog some day, when I feel it's ready for prime time.</p>
			<p>The main web technologies used here right now are:
				<ul>
					<li>HTML</li>
					<li>CSS <i>(using Sass for preprocessing)</i></li>
					<li>Angular.js <i>(and once it's in a good place, I'll see about Angular 2)</i></li>
					<li>jQuery</li>
					<li>Apache HTTPD web server</li>
					<li>SVG</li>
					<li>MongoDB - currently has 1 collection for reviews and 1 collection for user IDs/passwords</li>
					<li>Node.js & Express.js - handles AJAX requests between website and MongoDB</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The slideshow you see above (including somewhat odd choices of placeholder images) was the first big part of this project. I figured since pretty much every major website has one of those, I should try my hand at it. Using Chrome with a touchscreen, or a mobile device, it should be touch-sensitive. Originally all of the slides were hard-coded, but they are now loaded in from a JSON file.</p>
			<p>The next major thing I worked on was the "music database" page. This is still a work in progress (moreso than everything else) and I plan to separate it out into its own thing eventually. (But then I wouldn't have enough links on the navbar!)</p>
			<p>I hope you enjoy this site, for whatever it's worth right now. Try not to break anything!</p>
